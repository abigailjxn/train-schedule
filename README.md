Didn't get to extra challenges, but played around and got familiar with Semantic UI framework to use for the upcoming Project 1.

Issues: 
1. Data will be reset after a page reload and on a submit click because it's creating new variables. Any way to fix?

Tried doing .push instead of .set, but it created extra branches.

2. Lots of repeating code for the different columns. Any way to wrap these in functions?
